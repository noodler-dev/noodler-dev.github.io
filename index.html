        <p class="text-muted">You can't improve what you can't see.</p>

        <p>Teams are spending more on tokens, infrastructure, and experimentation than ever before – but progress is
            often slow, opaque, and frustrating. Without clear feedback loops, it's hard to know what's working, what
            isn't, or how to improve reliably.</p>

        <p>A recent MIT study found that <b>95% of organizations report little to no measurable ROI from their GenAI
                initiatives</b>.</p>

        <p>The problem isn't ambition. It's <i>visibility</i>.</p>

        <p>AI applications behave differently from traditional software. LLM outputs are probabilistic,
            context-dependent, and difficult to evaluate with conventional metrics.</p>

        <p>We've built and shipped AI systems ourselves – and we've felt how easy it is to optimize the wrong thing, or
            rely on intuition instead of evidence.</p>

        <p><b>Noodler</b> is an open-source suite of evaluation tools for AI applications.</p>

        <p>Our first product tackles observability, you can't improve what you can't see.</p>
